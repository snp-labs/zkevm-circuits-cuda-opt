# ZKEVM Bus-Mapping

![GitHub Workflow Status (branch)](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/appliedzkp/zkevm-circuits/CI%20checks/main?style=for-the-badge)

`Bus-Mapping` is a crate designed to parse EVM execution traces and manipulate
all of the data they provide in order to obtain structured witness inputs
for the EVM Proof and the State Proof.

### Introduction
At the moment every node on ethereum has to validate every transaction in
the ethereum virtual machine. This means that every transaction adds work
that everyone needs to do to verify Ethereumâ€™s history. Worse still is that
each transaction needs to be verified by every new node. Which means the
amount of work a new node needs to do the sync the network is growing
constantly. We want to build a proof of validity for the Ethereum blocks to
avoid this.

This means making a proof of validity for the EVM + state reads / writes +
signatures.
To simplify we separate our proofs into two components.

- State proof: State/memory/stack ops have been performed correctly. This
does not check if the correct location has been read/written. We allow our
prover to pick any location here and in the EVM proof confirm it is correct.

- EVM proof: This checks that the correct opcode is called at the correct
time. It checks the validity of these opcodes. It also confirms that for
each of these opcodes the state proof performed the correct operation.

Only after verifying both proofs are we confident that that Ethereum block
is executed correctly.

### Bus Mapping
The goal of this crate is to serve as:
- A parsing lib for EVM execution traces.
- A way to infer some witness data that can only be constructed once we've
  analyzed the full exec trace.
- An easy interface to collect all of the data to witness into the circuits
  and witness it with few function calls.

### Parsing
Provided a JSON file or a JSON as a stream of bytes, which contains an
execution trace from an EVM, you can parse it and construct an
`ExecutionTrace` instance from it. That will automatically fill all of the
bus-mapping instances of each
[`ExecutionStep`](crate::exec_trace::ExecutionStep) plus fill in an
[`OperationContainer`](crate::operation::container::OperationContainer) with
all of the Memory, Stack and Storage ops performed by the provided trace.

Once you have the trace built (following the code found above) you can
basically:
- Get an iterator/vector over the `Stack`, `Memory` or `Storage` operations
  ordered on the way the State Proof needs.

On that way, we would get something like this for the Memory ops:
```text,ignore
| `key`  | `val`         | `rw`    | `gc` | Note                                     |
|:------:| ------------- | ------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `0x40` | `0`           | `Write` |      | Init                                     |
| `0x40` | `0x80`        | `Write` | 0    | Assume written at the begining of `code` |
| `0x40` | `0x80`        | `Read`  | 4    | `56 MLOAD`                               |
|   -    |               |         |      |                                          |
| `0x80` | `0`           | `Write` |      | Init                                     |
| `0x80` | `0xdeadbeef`  | `Write` | 10   | `63 MSTORE`                              |
| `0x80` | `0xdeadbeef`  | `Read`  | 16   | `70 MLOAD`                               |
| `0x80` | `0x1d97c6efb` | `Write` | 24   | `73 MSTORE`                              |
|   -    |               |         |      |                                          |
| `0xa0` | `0`           | `Write` |      | Init                                     |
| `0xa0` | `0xcafeb0ba`  | `Write` | 34   | `83 MSTORE`
```

Where as you see, we group by `memory_address` and then order by
`global_counter`.

- Iterate over the `ExecutionTrace` itself over
each `ExecutionStep`'s is formed by and check which Stack/Memory&Storage operations are linked to each step.
This is also automatically done via the
[`Opcode`](crate::evm::opcodes::Opcode) trait defined in this crate.
